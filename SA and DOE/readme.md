<h1> Sensitivity analysis and Design of Experiment</h1>

The overall goal of this step is to identify the optimum range for input parameters that can completely cover the range of variations in target parameter/s. For example, this study aims to estimate the permeability changes due to polymer gel injection. DOE helps us propose a set of gelation thresholds and a power-law index for the simulation set on a rock sample that covers all the possible ranges for permeability changes. The required number of samples is not obtained according to a specific relationship, but obviously, it depends on the model's complexity. The more complex the model, the more samples are needed, which ultimately increases the database's size. Careful DOE ensures the comprehensiveness of the final developed model.
we did sensitivity analysis and design of experiment. 

For this part, 2240 simulations were performed with input parameters from Table 4 to select their optimal values for numerical simulation. Then, a pairwise sensitivity analysis is carried out on generated simulation results to identify the input parameters with a higher risk of divergence. Figure 9 shows the percentage of simulation divergence for each pair of input parameters in which brighter blocks have a higher risk of divergence. As can be seen from below figure, the simulations with low values of n and Nu0 and high values of the pressure difference and Cu have a higher chance of diverging.
