<h2> Build ANN to predict permeability changes</h2>
In this repository, we go through different steps to build Artificial Neural Network (ANN) which could predict reduction in permeability as a result of injecting polymer gel in a fraction of a second. The dataset for this ANN in generated from numerical simulations, which codes for these simulations are available on https://github.com/kamelelahe/NN-LBM

To take a brife look, different steps for this reasearch are shown in below figure.

up to the goal of this reasearch, some steps such as post processing, sensitivoty analysis and also building ANN are done with python. this repository contains all of python code in seperate folders. in each foler the readme.md file explains the code and also some details about different parts of the code are written within the file.
