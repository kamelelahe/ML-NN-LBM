This python code helps us to depict final geometry of porous media after polymer gel injection.
for each simulation result, different threshold( ie. max omega in which polymer gel can still flow as a fluid) is considered 
The ouput of this code is pictures of final porous media geometries in gif format.
It should be noted that since the size of data(input omega fields and output pictures) are too big, we did not include them in repository. But There are some samples available in this folder.
